when g++ compiling StackArray.cpp

it successfully completed it in my machine (MacBook Pro), but it wasn't in Linux bash on ICS server.

the error happened in the function void empty All.

my machine: ofstream f(output_file, ios::app); ---> no problem while compiling, but error on Linux.

so, tried and changed, and it works. 

ofstream f(output_file.c_str(), ios:out); ---> I think ios:out and ios:app are not the matters.



what is c_str()?
